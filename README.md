# Heads up  

yes im very inconsistent, because sometimes  
i feel like building modular enterprise code  
but most of the time ill build it as simple  
as possible.  

## heres a qoute for ya  

"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires   
simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple,   
for an idiot anything the more complicated it is   
the more he will admire it, if you make something   
so clusterfucked he can't understand it he's gonna   
think you're a god cause you made it so complicated   
nobody can understand it. That's how they write   
journals in Academics, they try to make it so   
complicated people think you're a genius"
